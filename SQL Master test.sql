-- âš™ Section 2: Practical â€“ Easy (Write SQL)

-- 1 Create a table named departments with columns:
 CREATE TABLE departments(
 dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
 dept_name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
 location VARCHAR(50)
 );
 
 SELECT * FROM departments;
 
 -- 2 Insert these records into departments:
INSERT INTO departments (dept_id,dept_name,location)
VALUES (1, 'HR', 'New York'),
(2, 'IT', 'San Francisco'),
(3, 'Finance', 'Chicago');

-- 3 Write a query to display all columns from departments. 
SELECT * FROM departments;

-- 4 Write a query to get only department names and locations from departments.
SELECT dept_name , location
FROM departments;

-- 5 Write a query to change the location of the IT department to "Los Angeles".
UPDATE departments
SET location = "Los Angeles"
WHERE dept_name = "IT";

SELECT * FROM departments;

-- âš™ Section 3: Practical â€“ Medium

-- 1 Create a table employees with:
CREATE TABLE employee(
emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
emp_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
salary DECIMAL,
dept_id INT,
FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES departments(dept_id)
);

-- 2 Insert:
INSERT INTO employee (emp_id, emp_name, salary, dept_id)
VALUES (105, 'Eva', 68000, 1),
(106, 'Frank', 82000, 3),
(107, 'Grace', 60000, 2),

(119, 'Steve', 79000, 3),
(120, 'Tina', 61000, 2);

-- 3 Write a query to get employee names with their department names.
SELECT d.dept_name , e.emp_name
FROM departments d
LEFT JOIN employee e
ON d.dept_id = e.dept_id;

-- 4 Write a query to find employees whose salary is above the average salary.
SELECT emp_name FROM employee
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employee);

-- 5. Write a query to find the department with the highest total salary.
SELECT dept_name FROM departments
WHERE dept_id = (SELECT dept_id FROM employee
ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 1);

-- ðŸ”¥ Section 4: Practical â€“ Hard (Bonus Challenges)

-- Write a query to get the top 2 highest salaries in each department.

SELECT * FROM departments;

SELECT emp_name , salary ,dept_id 
FROM employee e
WHERE salary = (
	SELECT salary
    FROM employee
